# October-Effic-2022
Demos arent really sorted or whatever, all vs all (for seeding) on dust2 is included in the eu1 folder. Demo names include the timestamp with mapname, so best bet is probably to look out for that. effic_2_10_2022.txt includes all events listed by time and mapname aswell.
Map count for the tourney was following:
- turbine:    16
- ot:         6
- frozen:     5
- aard3c:     5
- simplicity: 4
- memento:    2
- academy:    1
